SOD is an embedded, modern cross-platform computer vision and machine learning software library that expose a set of APIs for deep-learning, advanced media analysis & processing including real-time, multi-class object detection and model training on embedded systems with limited computational resource and IoT devices.

SOD was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in open source as well commercial products.

Designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. SOD includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art deep-neural networks with their <a href="https://pixlab.io/downloads" target="_blank">pre-trained models</a>. Built with SOD:
* <a href="https://sod.pixlab.io/intro.html#cnn">Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</a> for multi-class (20 and 80) object detection & classification.
* <a href="https://sod.pixlab.io/api.html#cnn">Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)</a> for text generation (i.e. Shakespeare, 4chan, Kant, Python code, etc.).
* <a href="https://sod.pixlab.io/samples.html">Decision trees</a> for single class, real-time object detection.
* A brand new architecture written specifically for SOD named <a href="https://sod.pixlab.io/intro.html#realnets">RealNets</a>.
